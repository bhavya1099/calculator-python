### Scenario 1: Multiplication of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_two_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the multiplication function correctly multiplies two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integer values.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with these two integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the product of the two integers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality of multiplying two positive integers is working as intended, which is a fundamental operation for the function.

### Scenario 2: Multiplication of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_two_negative_integers
  Description: Ensure the multiplication function correctly multiplies two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integer values.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with these two integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the positive product of their magnitudes.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function handles the multiplication of negative numbers correctly, producing a positive result as expected in mathematics.

### Scenario 3: Multiplication of a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Test if the multiplication function correctly multiplies a positive integer with a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one positive and one negative integer.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with these integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is a negative number which is the product of their magnitudes.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's ability to handle cases where one number is negative and the other positive, resulting in a negative product.

### Scenario 4: Multiplication by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_by_zero
  Description: Verify that multiplying any number by zero returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-zero integer and zero.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with the non-zero integer and zero.
  Assert: Check that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as multiplying by zero should always result in zero, regardless of the other number, confirming the function adheres to this mathematical rule.

### Scenario 5: Multiplication of two floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_two_floats
  Description: Test the multiplication function with two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two floating-point values.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with these floats.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the product of the two floats.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function accurately handles floating-point arithmetic, which is essential for operations involving non-integer numbers.

### Scenario 6: Multiplication of large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_large_numbers
  Description: Ensure the multiplication function can handle and correctly multiply large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two very large integer values.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with these large numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected large product.
Validation:
  Testing with large values ensures that the function can handle and correctly compute products of large magnitudes without overflow errors or incorrect calculations.

### Scenario 7: Multiplication leading to a very small product
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_resulting_in_small_product
  Description: Verify the function's ability to handle cases where the product is a very small number close to zero, using floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two small floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with these small floats.
  Assert: Check that the result is a very small number close to zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can accurately compute and return very small products, which is crucial for precise scientific calculations.

Each of these scenarios is designed to validate both the typical and boundary case functionality of the multiplication function, ensuring it meets all expected mathematical properties and handles various types of input correctly.
