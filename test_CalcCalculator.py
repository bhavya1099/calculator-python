ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=calculator_ad84dc0779


**Scenario 1: Test addition operation**
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_addition
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs the addition operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the operation set to '+'.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator delegates to the addition function correctly and handles basic addition as expected.

**Scenario 2: Test subtraction operation**
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_subtraction
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs the subtraction operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the operation set to '-'.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to num1 minus num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator delegates to the subtraction function correctly and handles basic subtraction as expected.

**Scenario 3: Test multiplication operation**
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_multiplication
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs the multiplication operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the operation set to '*'.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to num1 multiplied by num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator delegates to the multiplication function correctly and handles basic multiplication as expected.

**Scenario 4: Test division operation with non-zero divisor**
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_division
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs the division operation when the divisor is non-zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two numbers, num1 and num2, where num2 is not zero.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the operation set to '/'.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator delegates to the division function correctly and handles basic division as expected.

**Scenario 5: Test division by zero**
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_division_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the calculator returns an appropriate error message when attempting to divide by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two numbers, num1 and num2, where num2 is zero.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the operation set to '/'.
  Assert: Check that the result is "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test verifies that the calculator handles the error case of division by zero correctly, returning a meaningful message.

**Scenario 6: Test invalid operation**
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_invalid_operation
  Description: Verify that the calculator returns an appropriate error message when an invalid operation is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with an operation that is not one of the defined operations ('+', '-', '*', '/').
  Assert: Check that the result is "Invalid operation".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator handles unknown operations appropriately by returning an error message, thus maintaining robustness.

These scenarios cover a comprehensive range of expected inputs and error conditions, ensuring that the calculator function behaves as specified under various circumstances.
