### Scenario 1: Valid Division
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_positive_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly divides two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `division(10, 5)`.
  Assert: The result should be 2.0.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function handles typical division scenarios correctly. The expected result is derived from the basic mathematical operation of division, ensuring that the function adheres to mathematical standards.

### Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: This test checks the function's response when the second argument (divisor) is zero, which should trigger a specific return value.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `division(10, 0)`.
  Assert: The result should be "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial as division by zero is mathematically undefined and must be handled explicitly in software to prevent runtime errors. The function's specification to return a specific message ensures user-friendly error handling.

### Scenario 3: Negative Division
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Tests the function's ability to handle division where the dividend or the divisor is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `division(-10, 2)` and `division(10, -2)`.
  Assert: The results should be -5.0 and -5.0, respectively.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative numbers, maintaining the mathematical rule that dividing by a negative number inverts the sign of the quotient. This is important for accurate mathematical computations.

### Scenario 4: Fractional Results
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_fraction
  Description: Verifies that the function can handle and return fractional results accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `division(1, 2)`.
  Assert: The result should be 0.5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles divisions that result in non-integer quotients. This precision is vital for applications requiring exact decimal results, confirming the function's utility in diverse mathematical contexts.

### Scenario 5: Large Number Division
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_large_numbers
  Description: Ensures that the function can handle very large integers without overflow or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `division(1000000000, 2)`.
  Assert: The result should be 500000000.0.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's reliability and robustness when dealing with large numbers, which is essential for applications processing high-value data sets or requiring high precision.

### Scenario 6: Division of Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_zero
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when the dividend is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `division(0, 5)`.
  Assert: The result should be 0.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly identifies zero as the numerator and returns zero as the result, adhering to the mathematical property that zero divided by any non-zero number is zero.
